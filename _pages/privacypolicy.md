# Privacy Policy

We respect your privacy and are committed to protecting it. This Privacy Policy describes how we collect, use, and disclose information through our iOS mobile application Aisten (the "App").

## Information We Collect

We do not collect any personal information from users of our App. The App does not require any user registration or account creation.

## Information We DO NOT Collect

We do not collect any personal data such as your name, email address, phone number, photos, location information, or any other identifiers. The App also does not access your contact list or calendar on your device.

## Use of Information

As we do not collect any personal information, there is no user data that we use or share with third parties.

## In-App Purchases

The App allows users to purchase access to premium content and features through in-app purchases. Any transactions are processed by the Apple App Store's payment system, not by us, so we do not receive or store any payment information.

## Children's Privacy

Our App does not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If we learn that personal information of a child under 13 has been collected, we will take steps to delete such information.

## Security

As the App does not collect or store any user information, specific security measures are not applicable. However, we take care to release updates and bug fixes for the App as needed.

## Changes to this Policy

We may occasionally update this Privacy Policy. When we do, we will also revise the "Last Updated" date below. We recommend you periodically review this Policy to stay informed about how we are protecting the personal information we collect. Your continued use of the App constitutes your agreement to this Privacy Policy and any updates.
